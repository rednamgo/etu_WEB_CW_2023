# etu_WEB_CW_2023
Course work for the Web-technologies class in ETU uni. 

## Notice
_This code is for study purposes only._ It is a half-baked @D-game-monster of Frankenstein made in the panic right before the deadline so it could use **a lot** code improvements and needs some serios refactoring. But, **it works**.

## Tasks
1. Written in "pure" JS ES6 (debatable)
2. Two game levels minimum
3. All managers from the "textbook" must be included
4. Scores Table (nope)
5. Obstacles
6. "Intellectual" enemies and "bonuses"
7. Use Tiled Map Editor

**DONE: 6/7**

## Things to improve
1. Implement correct Game Over logic
2. Game Stats bar in the separate(?) <canvas> on the left
3. Score Table at the end of the game
4. Diffirentate Enemy behavior depending on the Enemy type
5. _There is a bug when you open the game again after loosing - Player is dying in one hit_
6. Use game time as multiplicator for the final score to inspire more competitive behavior
7. Flip the Entity sprite when it movemend direction along the X axis changes (flipped sprites included in the assets folder already)
